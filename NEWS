0.98.3
------

Here are the new features and improvements in ClamAV 0.98.3:

    - Support for common raw disk image formats using 512 byte sectors,
      specifically GPT, APM, and MBR partitioning.

    - Experimental support of OpenIOC files. ClamAV will now extract file
      hashes from OpenIOC files residing in the signature database location,
      and generate ClamAV hash signatures. ClamAV uses no other OpenIOC
      features at this time. No OpenIOC files will be delivered through
      freshclam. See openioc.org and iocbucket.com for additional information
      about OpenIOC.

    - All ClamAV sockets (clamd, freshclam, clamav-milter, clamdscan, clamdtop)
      now support IPV6 addresses and configuration parameters.

    - Use OpenSSL file hash functions for improved performance. OpenSSL 
      is now prerequisite software for ClamAV 0.98.2.

    - Improved detection of malware scripts within image files. Issue reported
      by Maarten Broekman.

    - Change to circumvent possible denial of service when processing icons within
      specially crafted PE files. Icon limits are now in place with corresponding
      clamd and clamscan configuration parameters. This issue was reported by 
      Joxean Koret.

    - Improvements to the fidelity of the ClamAV pattern matcher, an issue
      reported by Christian Blichmann.

    - Opt-in collection of statistics. Statistics collected are: sizes and MD5 
      hashes of files, PE file section counts and section MD5 hashes, and names
      and counts of detected viruses. Enable statistics collection with the
      --enable-stats clamscan flag or StatsEnabled clamd configuration
      parameter.

    - Improvements to ClamAV build process, unit tests, and platform support with
      assistance and suggestions by Sebastian Andrzej Siewior, Scott Kitterman,
      and Dave Simonson.

    - Patch by Arkadiusz Miskiewicz to improve error handling in freshclam.

    - ClamAV 0.98.2 also includes miscellaneous bug fixes and documentation 
      improvements.
