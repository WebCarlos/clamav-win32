----

This release of ClamAV introduces new malware detection mechanisms and other
significant improvements to the scan engine. The key features include:

    - The Bytecode Interpreter: the interpreter built into LibClamAV allows
      the signature writers to create and distribute very complex detection
      routines and remotely enhance the scanner's functionality

    - Heuristic improvements: improve the PE heuristics detection engine by
      adding support of bogus icons and fake PE header information. In a
      nutshell, ClamAV can now detect malware that tries to disguise itself
      as a harmless application by using the most common Windows program icons.

    - Signature Improvements: logical signature improvements to allow more
      detailed matching and referencing groups of signatures. Additionally,
      improvements to wildcard matching on word boundaries and newlines.

    - Support for new archives: 7zip, InstallShield and CPIO. LibClamAV
      can now transparently unpack and inspect their contents.

    - Support for new executable file formats: 64-bit ELF files and OS X
      Universal Binaries with Mach-O files. Additionally, the PE module
      can now decompress and inspect executables packed with UPX 3.0.

    - Support for DazukoFS in clamd

    - Performance improvements: overall performance improvements and memory
      optimizations for a better overall resource utilization experience.

    - Native Windows Support: ClamAV will now build natively under Visual
      Studio. This will allow 3rd Party application developers on Windows
      to easily integrate LibClamAV into their applications.
