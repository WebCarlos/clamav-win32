On-access scanning for OS X
---------------------------

The ClamAuth kernel extension enables ClamAV to provide on-access scanning
for Mac OS X 10.5 and later. The current version works in a passive mode
only - ClamAV will log the detection but won't block access to the infected
file. However, it's possible to perform special actions (eg. quarantine
files) with the VirusEvent directive of clamd.

Usage
-----

1. Run ClamAuth_load to load the kernel extension (you can edit the
script to change or add more paths that will be monitored).
2. Add "ClamAuth yes" to your clamd.conf
3. Start clamd with root privileges ('sudo /usr/local/sbin/clamd')

If clamd properly connects to the driver, you should see a line like this
in the log file:

ClamAuth: Driver version: 0.3, protocol version: 2

ClamAV is now monitoring the paths specified in ClamAuth_load.
