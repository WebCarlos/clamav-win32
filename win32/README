ClamAV for Win32
----------------

0- Requirements

To build the source code you will need:
- Git for windows with a git "shell"
- Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 (the express version is just fine)

To run the binaries at least Windows 2000 is required. Microsoft Visual C++ 2008
runtime libraries needs to be installed on the system. See:

1- Getting the code

The win32 source code is merged in the ClamAV repository and is available
via git.
Clone the repository with: git clone git://git.clamav.net/git/clamav-devel
See http://www.clamav.net/download/sources for more info.


2- Code configuration

After downloading the source code, minimal configuration is required:
just run the win32/configure.bat script *from within the git shell*.
Skip this step if you are building from an official release tarball.


3- Compilation

Open win32/ClamAV.sln in Visual Studio and build all.
The output directory for the binaries is either /win32/Debug or /win32/Release,
depending on the configuration you pick.


4- Special notes

The ClamAV tools in win32 are the same as in unix, so refer to their respective
manpage for general usage.
The major differences are listed below:
- Config files path search order:
  1- The content of the registry key "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/Software/ClamAV/ConfDir"
  2- The directory where libclamav.dll is located
  3- "C:\ClamAV"

- Database files path search order:
  1- The content of the registry key "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/Software/ClamAV/DataDir"
  2- The directory "database" inside the directory where libclamav.dll is located
  3- "C:\ClamAV\db"

- Globbing
Since the windows command prompt doesn't take care of wildcard expansion, minimal
emulation of unix glob() is performed internally. It supports "*" and "?" only.

- File paths
Please always use the backslash as the path separator.
SMB Network shares and UNC paths are supported.
